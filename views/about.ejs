                <p>Hello there! My name is <strong style="font-size: larger;">Ashutosh Kansal</strong>, and I'm
                    currently
                    pursuing a Software
                    Engineering Technician
                    course at Centennial College. I'm in my third semester of the four-semester program.
                    Originally from
                    Punjab, India, I have always had a passion for coding, particularly in the field of web
                    development.
                    Over time, I have gained experience by creating various portfolio websites that showcase my
                    skills and
                    creativity. Additionally, I have also developed software solutions for different businesses,
                    such as
                    grocery stores and libraries. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world
                    problems and
                    improve people's lives. With a strong dedication to continuous learning and a keen eye for
                    detail, I
                    strive to deliver high-quality work and exceed expectations. I am excited to embark on new
                    challenges
                    and collaborate with others to create innovative solutions.</p>
